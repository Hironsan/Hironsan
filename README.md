### Hi there, I'm Hiroki 👋

I'm interested in creating software related to machine learning and natural language processing.

Also, I like writing and translating books in Japanese. Here are some examples:

Author

- [機械学習・深層学習による自然言語処理入門](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B084WPRT44/)

Translator

- [Deep Learning with Keras](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y2YMRDW/)（JP: [直感 Deep Learning](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4873118263/)）
- [Building Machine Learning Pipelines](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CXDBWTX/)（JP: [入門 機械学習パイプライン](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4873119510/)）
- [Practical Natural Language Processing]()（JP: [実践 自然言語処理](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4873119723/)）
